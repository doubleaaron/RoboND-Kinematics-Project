### Project Writeup / Kuka KR210 Pick and Place

### Kinematic Analysis
#### 1. Run the forward_kinematics demo and evaluate the kr210.urdf.xacro file to perform kinematic analysis of Kuka KR210 robot and derive its DH parameters.

To run Forward Kinematics I switched to ~/catkin_ws directory, sourced devel/setup.bash and ran roslaunch forward_kinematics.launch

Launched /catkin_ws/src/RoboND-Kinematics-Project/kuka_arm/urdf/kr210.urdf.xacro to perform kinematic analysis and derive Denavit Hartenberg parameters (JJ Craig method).

#### 2. Using the DH parameter table you derived earlier, create individual transformation matrices about each joint. In addition, also generate a generalized homogeneous transform between base_link and gripper_link using only end-effector(gripper) pose.

Parameter | Name | Definition   
--- | --- | ---
alpha(i-1) | Twist angle | Angle from z(i-1) axis to z(i) axis measured along the x(i-1) axis
a(i-1) | Link length | Distance from z(i-1) axis to z(i) axis measured along the x(i-1) axis
d(i) | Link offset | Distance from x(i-1) axis to x(i) axis measured along the z(i) axis
theta(i) | Joint variable | Angle from x(i-1) axis to x(i) axis measured along the z(i) axis
  
>>> In joint 2, it has a constant offset -90 degree between x(1) and x(2). 


#### 3. Decouple Inverse Kinematics problem into Inverse Position Kinematics and inverse Orientation Kinematics; doing so derive the equations to calculate all individual joint angles.

And here's where you can draw out and show your math for the derivation of your theta angles.

### Project Implementation

#### 1. Fill in the `IK_server.py` file with properly commented python code for calculating Inverse Kinematics based on previously performed Kinematic Analysis. Your code must guide the robot to successfully complete 8/10 pick and place cycles. Briefly discuss the code you implemented and your results. 


Here I'll talk about the code, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the implementation might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
